<h2 id="headline-1">
Aspects to Endurance - Cardio &amp; Muscular
</h2>
<h3 id="headline-2">
How to develop cardio
</h3>
<h4 id="headline-3">
Steady state exercise - run at particular speed not too fast
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Cause: Heart stretches when you increase heart rate upto a certain point which increases stroke volume(means a bigger heart)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Running at increased heart rate (90% +), heart is twitching and not effective
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Run at pace where you can have a sustained conversation
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="headline-4">
Interval Training
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Based on Inertia
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Run at 80-90% and then start jogging or walking, heart is still beating hard, extra volume of blood is moving which stretches the heart
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Interval found usefull after period of steady state training
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Easy to go wrong
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Walk till you can talk
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="headline-5">
How to Develop Muscular
</h3>
<h4 id="headline-6">
Need/Develop mitochondria in muscle cells
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Easy to do in slow fibers and harder to do in fast fibers
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Make muscle oxidative, enduring not polluting
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="headline-7">
3 main energy systems
</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
creatine phosphate
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
clean burning and for short durations
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
aerobic
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
less powerfull
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
longer lasting
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
glyocalytic
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
inbetween
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="headline-8">
Train in a way to produce less acid
</h4>
<h5 id="headline-9">
For slow fibers
</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
moving right below anerobic threshold
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Anaerobic is intensity where acid is accumulating at rate where the body can dispose at the same rate
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
above anaerobic threshold when you are failing the talk test
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="headline-10">
For fast fibers
</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
N/A :) because I had stopped watching the video by this point of time
</p>
</li>
</ul>
