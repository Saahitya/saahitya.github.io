      <title>Crossing Bridges(2013) Review</title>

      <description>Crossing Bridges(2013) is an unusual movie. Unlike a typical Bollywood movie, it does not have drama, nor is it like the recent Biopicy style movies that show the protagonist overcoming an obstacle, yet the movie was engrossing and my connection with the protagonist so strong that I did not pick up my phone more than twice while watching it.
– SPOILERS AHEAD –
The movie starts by showing a man called Tashi who has returned to his village in Arunachal Pradesh from Mumbai after being laid off.</description>

      <title>Simple Drupal 7 Shell</title>
      <link>https://saahitya.github.io/posts/drupal-shell/</link>

      <description>Problem For debugging drupal 7 code, there is no packaged shell like django or ROR and we must start a normal PHP interactive shell and then initialize and bootstrap the DRUPAL installation in the shell. This involves searching and copying the 4 lines of drupal initialization and bootstrapping code from the project and pasting it in the PHP shell before doing any Drupal debugging work.
Solution PHP CLI has an settings option auto_prepend_file which can be used to run some initialization code before running the PHP interactive shell with php -a.</description>

      <title>TIL MySQL GROUP_CONCATE truncates to 1024</title>

      <description>https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_group-concat
In another case of the being burned due to not looking at the documentation properly and blindly copying a query,the root cause of a field issue turned out to be MySQL function GROUP_CONCATE truncating the result of the query to 1024 by default unless group_concat_max_len is set explicitly. Plus depending on the way of processing this query results in your program, it is unlikely to figure out the results were ever truncated.</description>

      <description>Recently saw someone looking at the history of their all the cut-copy text when presenting their screen in a call. One day later after installing https://maccy.app/, how the heck did I not know something like this(clipboard managers) ever existed before.
 Very usefull for navigating large legacy codebases with bad editor support and the only way to navigate between functions is copying the function name and finding it Pasting commands to run in the terminal shell of a remote servers that you forgot and had run in another remote server.</description>

      <description>Setting up proper logging today prevents the big headache tommorow
Components  syslog - inbuilt drupal module to log drupal errors(no particular reason for choosing this module, can use any appropriate module that logs to file or write a module that implements hook_watchdog) logrotate - to archive the old logs to help classify by data and save space.  Steps  We enable syslog in the modules in drupal and save with the default config add a file in /etc/rsyslog.</description>

      <title>The Most Important Design Guideline</title>

      <description>In college we were taught SOLID and GRASP principles which was more heuristics than principles1 that was supposed to make our code better. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know whether applying them helps as I never could remember it and I definitely wasn&amp;#39;t thinking about applying it when I was writing code. But one thing that did stay with me from college that was taught and repeated dozens of times by a great professor was the idea of interface and implementation, which was beautifully taught in C++ with the interface being written in the header file and the implementation being written in the library source file.</description>

      <description>Notes taken while listening to Building Endurance the Right Way
Aspects to Endurance - Cardio &amp;amp; Muscular  How to develop cardio  Steady state exercise - run at particular speed not too fast    Cause: Heart stretches when you increase heart rate upto a certain point which increases stroke volume(means a bigger heart)
  Running at increased heart rate (90% +), heart is twitching and not effective</description>

      <description>I have a definitely-not-well-thought-out theory about ESG(Environmental, Social and Goverance) stocks. Hunch: ESG stocks will continue to generally always give better returns than the overall stock market.    In 10th grade I remember our English teacher asking whether it is moral for a person to own a luxury car since it is so polluting and one of my classmates made the point that people buy luxury cars as status symbol.</description>

      <description>For the first time ever, I ran a 4k in the night at 11:30 PM around my apartment, that too after staying up for a software release. People talk about starting your day fresh after a run inconveniantly missing out the part about waking up early in the morning, and hustling after the run to get to work on time. In contrast when you run at night, you really don&amp;#39;t have anything to get back to except your bed and when you do get back you obviously will sleep like a log cause you are tired after running.</description>

      <description>Overall my memory of the race is very hazy and I remeber very specific parts of the race with not much long term context to it The beginning parts of the race involved a lot of shifting between lanes as some people were running slow and it was still relatively crowded approx for atleast 5-7 kms.
The course through cubbon park was generally very cool and the air there was very fresh.</description>

      <description>If you are going to put up some pictures on the internet you&amp;rsquo;ve got to atleast put up nice aesthetic color-graded shots or atleast have some person in it, unless you are me in which case you can put up pictures of random things, label it terribly and get away with it.
