				<p>Overall my memory of the race is very hazy and I remeber very specific parts of the race with not much long term context to it
The beginning parts of the race involved a lot of shifting between lanes as some people were running slow and it was still relatively crowded approx for atleast 5-7 kms.</p>
<p>The course through cubbon park was generally very cool and the air there was very fresh. I remember while running through cubbon park at a later part of the race I saw this park filled with tons of dogs cheering for me :)</p>
<p>While going through the 10km point - around the U turn at the cubbon park road, for the first time I felt that my pace was very hard to keep up and I had to slow down to conserve energy for the last quarter of the race.</p>
<p>The run along MG road was the time I remember becoming consistently inconsistent. I switched between running and walking atleast half a dozen times along the MG road.I also felt very uncomfortable running back from the MG road U turn because the sun was up and it was becoming incredibly hot and sunny.</p>
<p>Somewhere in cubbon park while coming back, I felt like I hit a wall physically, I was ahead of both the 2:00 pacers until then and remember trying desperately to run along with them as they ran and crossed me.</p>
<p>The last 2-3 km were especially hard for me, and I have no recollections of it except a lot of people were cheering for the runners in general (I remember a hilarious sign &ldquo;DONUT STOP&rdquo; and guys wearing pirate hats).For some reason I could sprint towards the finish line even though I was very exhausted.</p>
<p>Throughout the race, I hydrated myself appropriately, I almost always drank a gulp of water, sometimes electrolyte at the eventh kilometer and never felt dehydrated.</p>
